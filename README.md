# LocoSway
These files give an example of how locomotion sway is assessed according to the publication: 
Timotius et al., "Dynamic footprint based locomotion sway assessment in  alpha-synucleinopatic mice using Fast Fourier Transform and Low Pass Filter,"  Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 2018.

Three different methods of assessing sway are presented in the publication.
These methods can be computed using these three MATLAB functions.
In using this function, user can choose which paws are used in the calculation (all, fore-, or hind-).
